	//PAGE 1:
	//	a screenshot of that sample character in a fight on the first floor
	//	text is a basic overview of combat
	//		dodges and blocks are resources that refill when not in a fight, or manually with dodge and other special moves
	//		some attacks cannot be blocked or dodged, as mentioned in their descriptions
	//		many moves have minimum or maximum range
	//		every attack has an element; some enemies may be resistant or weak to various elements
	//PAGE 2:
	//	a screenshot of a guardian on top of a teleport pad
	//	text is a simple statement of your goal and very barebones plot overview
	//		this series of caverns inhabited by the ancient Eol was recently re-discovered
	//		everyone wants to get to the bottom-most layer, where there is a functional Eol vessel (maybe super-quick faction overview if there's room)
	//		you were, for some reason or another, exiled; your only hope is to get past EVERYONE to get to the vessel
	//		get to the teleporter at the top of each floor to continue down
